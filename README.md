# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

  The purpose of this project was take to take a look at 12 stocks and evalute their performance over the course of two years (2017, 2018). I was tasked with refactoring a macro of to help run more efficiently since we have included more stocks to analyize.
  
## Results

### 2017 Stock Performances

- Clearly this was a great year in the overall market. We can see that every stock in most industries did well. Something worth nothing is the ticker 'TERP' maybe be a type of counter cyclical stock that performs in a inverse relationship from the other stocks. 

### 2018 Stock Performances

- Looking at the performance of all the stocks in 2018 we see a very opposite perfomance in the stocks return % than in 2017. Most stocks that were doing well plummeted severly. This is a trend throughout the market. Looking closley at stock 'ENPH' 'RUN' we see that they have positive return % both in the 2017 and 2018. This gives us an idead that they could possibly be defense stocks that typically perform well regardless of the overall market trend. 

## Summary 
 
 1. The advantages of refractored code, is that it helps be more efficient with speed and how it manages memory, and when analyzing larger sums of data this is important. Some disadvantages to refactoring your code is the time that may go into making functions more efficient. There are some cases where you don't have the luxury of time to refactor code for efficiency. So there's always a balance when considereng efficiency and time. 
  
 2. The advantages of the original VBA script is that it was written  quciker and there was less efficiency. The VBS script took more time to write but was more efficient.
